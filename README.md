I've made this alternative location for documentation and files for the Celestron Homebrew Gadget 3 by Mark Lord. This will be removed if an official GitHub becomes available.

[BIN file for direct flashing](https://rtr.ca/hbg3/flashing/hbg3.bin)
This link will always download the latest binary file direct from MLORD - the creator. It is the fastest and less fuss method for getting the code onto an ESP32. See the WiKi for full step by step.
